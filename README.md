Derivatives and Portfolio Management Projects

This folder contains a set of interconnected projects, focusing on derivative pricing, variance reduction techniques, and a full-stack portfolio management system.

Contents

📊 Monte Carlo Simulation
Implementation of Monte Carlo methods for pricing financial derivatives, including:

Basic simulation of option payoffs  
Numerical estimation of expected values and standard errors  

♻️ Variance Reduction Techniques ->  
Enhanced pricing accuracy using:  
Antithetic Variates  
Delta Control Variates  
These techniques are applied to reduce simulation variance and improve convergence rates  

🔧 Delta Variate Implementation ->  
Demonstrates how delta-based control variates are used in derivative pricing. Includes:  
Calculation of option deltas  
Analytical and numerical comparisons  

🧠 Portfolio Management System ->  
A complete full-stack application for real-time trade management and risk analytics:  
Backend: C# with ASP.NET Core + PostgreSQL  
Frontend: ReactJS with Ant Design  
Features dynamic trade updates, Greek recalculations, and a responsive UI  

Technologies Used ->  
Python (for quantitative modeling)  
C#, ASP.NET Core (backend)  
PostgreSQL (database)  
ReactJS, Ant Design (frontend)  
Monte Carlo Simulation, Variance Reduction, Derivatives Pricing
